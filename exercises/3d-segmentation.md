# Instance segmentation for bio-image analysis in 3d

Segmenting the structures of interest is an important task for analysing microscopy images.
We have already covered this [in an exercise on the second day](https://github.com/constantinpape/training-deep-learning-models-for-vison/tree/master/day3#exercises).
However, for many applications the microscopy data is 3 dimensional; and the segmentation task more difficult.
For this exercise, we will use publicly available data from confocal microscopy that
shows plant cells during development: [dataset](https://osf.io/w38uf/).
