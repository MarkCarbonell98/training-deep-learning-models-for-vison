# Day 3

## Content
On the third day, we will focus on fully convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation.
in particular the U-Net architecture. The lectures will cover ([you can find the slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOoYWhxi5_niWBCZnHqSQBTqts5eWRqiVyTnKTBi8_M/edit?usp=sharing)):
- A quick introduction to semantic segmentation with convolutional neural networks
- U-Net architecture for bioimage segmentation
- Variants of the U-Net architecture (residual blocks, normalization layers, upsampling layers)
- Other applications: Image denoising with U-Net
- More on loss functions

### Exercises:
